The following are good resources for learning more about logic programming:

- [Î¼Kanren: A Minimal Functional Core for Relational Programming (pdf)](http://webyrd.net/scheme-2013/papers/HemannMuKanren2013.pdf) by Jason Hemann and Daniel P. Friedman

    This paper explores what forms the minimal logic programming language in Scheme. It strips away the complexity of more capable solvers to expose the core idea.

- [Hello, declarative world](http://codon.com/hello-declarative-world) by **[@tomstuart](https://github.com/tomstuart/)**

    A brief explanation of logic programming and a minimal language in Ruby.
    
- [The Reasoned Schemer](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0262562146/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0262562146&linkCode=as2&tag=mattdiephouse-20&linkId=40c4bb4569bbbfdf6c3a99f4e66490f4
) by Daniel P. Friedman, William E. Byrd and Oleg Kiselyov

    An unorthodox book, in the style of _The Little Schemer_, that has pages of exercises that demonstrate how a kaaren-style logic programming works.

- [Constraint Processing](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1558608907/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1558608907&linkCode=as2&tag=mattdiephouse-20&linkId=d518f0b1d4ccb6a9a8c6d772cec8c8ec) by Rina Dechter

    An in-depth look at constraints, algorithms, and optimizations. This book explains all you need to know to right a complex solver.
